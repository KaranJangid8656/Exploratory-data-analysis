##Interactive EDA Dashboard
An interactive and modern dashboard built using Streamlit that simplifies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Users can upload .csv or .xlsx datasets and instantly explore their data through visual insights — all without writing a single line of code.

📖 What is EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining a dataset to understand its structure, detect patterns, identify missing values, and uncover relationships between variables. It combines statistical techniques and visualizations to help analysts draw meaningful insights before moving to complex modeling or machine learning.

EDA is a foundational step in any data science or analytics project. It helps to:

Understand data distributions and outliers

Detect missing or incorrect values

Reveal correlations and trends

Make data-driven decisions with confidence
